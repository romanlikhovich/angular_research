# Frontend developer 
## AngulaRank challenge

In the heart of Github portal is repository. This is good but not for non-IT people. They would like to browse people and find interesting ones. This is your challenge.
Your goal is to pivot Github data in a way that users are in the center of it. To narrow our scope lets focus for the purpose of this exercise on Angular repo ​https://github.com/angular​. You can find there many repositories and each of them has its own contributors.


Your goal is to create an app that will rank Angular repositories contributors and show them in one list. The app will contain three distinct views:

* The list of contributors to all Angular repositories. The ranking should be sortable by amount of contributions made by developer to all repositories, by amount of followers, public repos & gists he/she published.
* The details page of each contributor with all repositories he contributed to and his details.
* The repository details page where we can find other contributors.
Judging criteria (top the most important)
* finished working sample
* creating a ​usable​ product (UX)
* compliance with ​professional​ standards of frontend work (correct way of handling css,
html, proper use of other libraries)
* code quality
* fluentness, responsiveness & performance
* appealing design (feel free to use some ​free stock images​, ​if you can prepare some
mockups that present the way you think about it etc.)

The sample project should be stored on your private Bitbucket repository and share it with `scalacio` user.
### Last word.
Working​ sample is more valuable than unfinished awesome fireworks that throw 100 errors. You can use any library available out there, but you must prove that it’s usage was carefully thought through.
Also, don’t be afraid to ​experiment​. We would rather see a novel approach to the topic, than a “framework X tutorial app”. Want to plugin additional API? Sure! Want to make pictures flow through the app? Why not. Want to break out from grid based image layout? If you can make it pretty and functional, we are more than fine with that.
You have one week to complete the challenge ​Good luck!
